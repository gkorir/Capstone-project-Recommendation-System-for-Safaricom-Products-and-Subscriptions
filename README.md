# Recommendation System for Safaricom Products and Subscriptions

## Project Proposal Readme

This project proposal presents a recommendation system that leverages machine learning to suggest cheaper and more affordable subscriptions to Safaricom customers. The system aims to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize subscription choices, and align with Safaricom's mission and vision of transforming lives and becoming a purpose-led technology company.

The recommendation system analyzes customer information, product details, usage patterns, and pricing to provide personalized recommendations to customers. By considering factors such as individual usage patterns, budget constraints, and service requirements, the system aims to help customers find subscription plans that align with their needs while offering significant cost savings.

The proposed solution is aligned with Safaricom's mission of transforming lives by improving the customer experience. It contributes to Safaricom's vision of becoming a purpose-led technology company by delivering value to customers and leveraging advanced technologies to solve real-world challenges.

## Project Background

Safaricom is a leading telecommunications company in Kenya, providing a wide range of services to millions of customers. With a strong customer base and a diverse portfolio of products, Safaricom faces the challenge of ensuring that customers are subscribed to the most suitable and cost-effective plans based on their individual needs. To address these challenges, Safaricom recognizes the potential of leveraging data engineering and machine learning techniques to develop a recommendation system.

The project proposal outlines the collaboration between Safaricom and Moringa School's Safaricom Digital Academy. The academy aims to empower aspiring data engineers and equip them with the skills and knowledge required to solve real-world challenges faced by Safaricom. Through this collaboration, the academy students will work closely with Safaricom mentors and utilize the available data to develop a robust recommendation system.

## Problem Statement

Safaricom customers may be subscribed to products and subscriptions that are not cost-effective or aligned with their usage patterns and budgets. This leads to potential inefficiencies in terms of customer spending and satisfaction. The proposed recommendation system addresses this problem by analyzing customer data, product information, and pricing to recommend more affordable and suitable subscriptions to customers.

Customers often struggle to navigate through the various subscription options and find the most cost-effective and suitable plans for their specific requirements. Additionally, customers' needs and preferences can change over time, and they may not be aware of new subscription options that better align with their evolving requirements. This lack of awareness and guidance can lead to suboptimal subscription choices and unnecessary spending.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to develop a recommendation system using machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data, product information, and pricing. The system will compare the customer's current subscription with available products, considering factors such as pricing, resources awarded, expiry date, and budget. If a more cost-effective and resource-rich subscription is identified, the system will recommend it to the customer.

The solution offers several key benefits, including improved customer experience, cost-effectiveness, informed decision-making, business growth, and collaboration and innovation. By providing personalized recommendations, customers can make informed decisions about their subscriptions, optimize their spending, and access services that better meet their requirements.

## Scope and Deliverables

The recommendation system will focus on analyzing customer data, product information, and pricing within the Safaricom ecosystem. It will consider factors such as customer usage, resources awarded, budget, and purchasing history. The system will not have a graphical user interface but will provide recommendations through an automated process.

The workplan includes several deliverables, including business understanding and objective setting, data collection and preparation, model development and evaluation, and recommendation system implementation. The project timeline and specific end dates for each deliverable will be determined during the project execution.

## Conclusion

The proposed recommendation system aims to enhance the customer experience, optimize subscription choices, and align with Safaricom's mission and vision
